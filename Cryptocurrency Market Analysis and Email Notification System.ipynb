    "# Cryptocurrency Market Analysis and Email Notification System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project is designed to fetch real-time cryptocurrency market data, generate investment reports, and send automated email notifications containing insights. The system utilizes the CoinGecko API to extract market trends and Python libraries for data processing, scheduling, and email automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "The script performs the following tasks:\n",
    "- Fetches cryptocurrency market data from CoinGecko API.\n",
    "- Analyzes and filters the top and bottom 10 cryptocurrencies based on 24-hour price change.\n",
    "- Generates a CSV report containing key market statistics.\n",
    "- Sends an automated email with the market summary and attached CSV report.\n",
    "- Uses scheduling to run the report generation and email dispatch daily at a fixed time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of the System\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. API Request and Data Extraction\n",
    "- The script requests market data from CoinGecko API.\n",
    "- Retrieves key cryptocurrency metrics such as price, market cap, all-time highs/lows, and price changes.\n",
    "- Converts the fetched JSON data into a structured Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Processing and Report Generation\n",
    "- Extracts the top 10 and bottom 10 cryptocurrencies based on 24-hour price change percentage.\n",
    "- Stores the processed data into a CSV file, including key metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Email Notification System\n",
    "- Configures an SMTP server for sending emails.\n",
    "- Formats an email containing market insights and attaches the generated CSV report.\n",
    "- Handles exceptions to ensure the reliability of the email dispatch function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Automation with Scheduling\n",
    "- Uses the `schedule` library to run the script daily at 8:00 AM.\n",
    "- Ensures timely execution of market data retrieval and email dispatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in the Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Fetching Cryptocurrency Data\n",
    "- Calls the CoinGecko API to retrieve real-time market data.\n",
    "- Parses the response and structures it into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Analysis\n",
    "- Selects relevant columns such as `id`, `current_price`, `market_cap`, `price_change_percentage_24h`, etc.\n",
    "- Identifies the top 10 best-performing and worst-performing cryptocurrencies.\n",
    "- Adds the current date for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Saving Data to CSV\n",
    "- Generates two reports: one for top 10 cryptocurrencies and one for bottom 10 cryptocurrencies.\n",
    "- Saves the reports as CSV files for further analysis and record-keeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Sending Email Notifications\n",
    "- Configures SMTP settings to send an email from a Gmail account.\n",
    "- Constructs an email containing market highlights.\n",
    "- Attaches the CSV report to the email.\n",
    "- Handles potential exceptions during email transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Automating Execution with Schedule\n",
    "- Uses the `schedule` module to execute the `get_crypto_report()` function daily at 8:00 AM.\n",
    "- Ensures consistency in data reporting and email updates.\n"
